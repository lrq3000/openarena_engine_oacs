Open AntiCheat System interface patch for OpenArena v0.8.8 engine + ioquake3 r2224
===============================================================================================

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is a patch to add an extended data recording facility inside the ioquake3/openarena engine, using JSON standard format.

This patch works as an interface between the ioquake3 engine data, and OACS.

The data output can then be processed inside [OACS (Open Anti-Cheat System framework)](https://github.com/lrq3000/oacs) and used for detecting cheating on your game servers.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS
(but it's pretty stable and has been used to collect gigabytes of players behavior data)
